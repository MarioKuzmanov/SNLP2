# SNLP2

this repository contains the official tutorials from **Statistical NLP2** taught in **SS25** @ University of Tübingen.
Here, you can find additional experiments, explanations, data.

## Setup

A virtual environment could be created by following these steps.

* **python 3.12**

```bash
# python3/path to python.exe
python3 -m venv .venv
    
# activate virtual environment (Windows)
source .venv/Scripts/activate
```

and in other distributions:

```bash
# activate virtual environment (Linux)
source .venv/bin/activate
```

After successful execution of the commands above, we should be now in the environment **.venv**

### N.B.

- the empty folders **a1, a2, a3, a4** contain the graded assignments for the ISCL (advanced BA and MA) students taking
  the course, therefore  solutions can be provided upon request.
-  **week_03, week_11** are based on the graded assignments, access via request

- **week_12** - potential project on Language Modeling
