Brian Noyes studied the grid thoroughly and has written a readable book which guide you in understanding the datagridview step by step.

"Akhenaten has long been a favorite of Egyptologists...and like many of the other reviewers I've followed the available published material over the years. Unlike some other works, this book is shorter and more readily accessible, especially for those without their MA in history. That said...if this topic interests you, please seek out more information. Other reviews have fabulous suggestions.Great illustrations, succinct text, and a new theory on the identity of ""Smenkhare"" make this book well worth reading.",2

"The usual suspects usually make music that is suspect. Huey is the current usual suspect that is destroying ears across america with this trash that he calls rap. The lyrics are elementary, lack subject matter, and are just down right terrible. Most of the time when you have a commercial album like this one, the beats are pretty dope. Not in this case. Huey has some boring/repetitive beats that sound like they were made on a really cheap casio. This album rates as one of the worst albums of the year. Do not, I repeat do not waste your money.",0

"Given her affinity for 1940's boogie woogie in the style of the Andrews Sisters, the idea of putting Bette Midler in a film that at least starts off during World War II seems like a natural. Indeed, you will find some nice period pieces by Midler, usually with Johnny Mercer's name on the composition, such as ""Come Rain or Come Shine."" But I have to admit to a slight sense of disappointment that the producers of this film seemed to go out of their way not to do anything too close to the songs that made the Divine Miss M famous in the first place. Ironically, the best track on the album is her wonderful cover of the Beatle's ""In My Life,"" which deservedly made its way onto Midler's greatest hits collection. This is a solid Midler album, the sort that comes in at 4.5 and then you round up or down according to your tastes.",2

"Great Jones Street is a wonderfully claire voyant novel that works sharply with themes that are of immense importance in the modern world. It is about pop arts, consumerism, the American junk culture and all the things that you can expect from DeLillo with the added element of dealing with problems with celebrity. Even when Bucky Wunderlick looks to escape from ""his"" life to be alone, his isolation becomes more valuable to others than it was meant to be to himself. This book deftly explores how the modern culture is dangerously obsessed with the lives of the few. Above all else, this is a more tightly structured novel than the later, greater works of DeLillo. Its opening pages lead right to the crux of the narrative and handles changes in time and place much smoother than Mao II and Underworld despite its hazy atmosphere.",2
"I would have to say that no engineer built/developed this thing,if one did they received their degree from the bottom of a cracker jack box. Putting this thing together was a bit of a challenge due to the placement of the bolts you need to tighten. It was very clear that the product I received had been put together once before, because the three areas that you need to screw/tighten were all scratched to hell (yep right out of box) One would think that they would of sent me a new unit (that's what I paid for) but it was clear that the unit I received was used before I got it. Once together it did the job, but required some skill to not tip the unit on turns. Save your money for something else, do not buy this unit.",0

"This watch is affordable and has a long battery life. It has good features, a nice display and is easy to use and set the time for - in either 12 or 24 hour time. It also has a stop watch function and can display two times, so you can switch between time zones if you want (or between normal and daylight savings time). This Timex is generally reliable and durable......except for the band, which is made of metal and really fragile rubber bits that have the unfortunate tendency to dry up and crack apart, leaving your watch unable to interface successfully with your wrist. Mine actually broke after about two months - I went and bought another band for this and now it serves me perfectly. My recommendation if you want a good solid watch is to buy this and get a cheap nylon cloth band along with it for when the original inevitably breaks.",2

For the price this watch is just about perfect for my needs. The fabric-like watch band is very durable and with the velcro closure it is easy to put on and take off. The face is easily readable, even at night with the Indiglo light at the touch of a button. After using the watch daily for about 8 months the velcro at the ends of the watch strap is beginning to lose some of its ""stickiness"" and I am now looking to replace the band with another just like it.",2

Although I own a fantastic instant thermometer (Thermapen) I wanted something I could clip onto a pot while cooking to measure temperature.

Despite the words ""instant read"" on the package it took 25-30 seconds for the temp to climb to 180 degrees....water boils at 212 degrees. I put my Thermapen into the boiling water and within 4 seconds the temperature registered 212 degrees. I left the Taylor in the boiling water for 2 minutes and the temperature never rose above 185 degrees.Stay away from this item if you need accuracy or speed.

"I used this book in High School Calculus. The entire class hated it. For the most part the examples are easily followed, although there are occasions where it was so confusing the teacher was unable to follow the steps they were illustrating. The worst thing about this book is that the examples tended to have almost nothing to do with the problems at the end of the chapter. To me this book seemed to follow the new need felt by many people to apply math to some sort of situation, which is all fine and dandy but you need to learn how to do something before you can apply it, especially in problems such as the ones in this book. When I came on looking for my College text books (I am retaking Calculus by the way) I was crushed to learn this is the text that we will be following.The best thing about this book is it's cover",0

"I was eager to peruse this book as I admire Brady's work immensely. But I was appalled and shocked at the amateurish nature of the captions, loaded with conjecture and unsubstantiated opinion on behalf of Webb Garrison. Truly a travesty that this book was published in this form as Mathew Brady's photographic documentation of the Civil War ushered in the era of Photojournalism and for it to be so mishandled and misconstrued at the hands of a hack such as Garrison is an unconscionable act of eternal shame for The Lyons Press, the publisher. Who edited this? Who proofread it, and fact checked? As far as I can tell no one fact checked anything that Garrison scribbled in some margins.What should have been a cherished volume in my library will end up down at Half Price books, if they'll take it. Avoid at all costs.",0

"Dixie Hemingway left the police force after the accidental death of her husband and daughter. She felt unable to deal with people, so she became a pet sitter.After arriving at the home of a wealthy client, Marilee, to care for her cat, Dixie discovers a man who apparently drowned in the cat's water bowl. She cannot locate Marilee, and soon finds herself in the middle of the investigation.Dixie meets quite a cast of characters and is soon looking for answers the police don't seem to be finding. This puts her in some sticky situations as well as finding another dead person. Can she prove her innocence by finding the guilty party without putting herself in danger?I really enjoyed Dixie. She is fun but also still grieving her loss. I also enjoyed the descriptions of the various pets she cares for. Her brother and his partner really added to the story as well.I enjoyed this first installment and cannot wait for the next book to be published. I highly recommend this book.",2

"This is a collection of very basic shell scripts I found completely useless. The author presents the book in an advanced format, not giving much underlying information or hand-holding; however the information contained is very beginner level.The author David Taylor also has many bad habits in his scripting and tends to take a wordy approach. Many of the scripts Taylor advertises in his book can be compiled into a command or two on a single small line of code. For example why would you pipe a grep command to awk when awk has a more powerful search function than grep already built in?I did not find any advanced commands in his entire book. There were a couple very basic 'sed' and 'awk' commands but nothing which made me think anything about them was 'wicked cool'",0

"The Simon Standage series of Telemann recordings are an excellent evocation of why Telemann was so popular during his lifetime. His orchestral music is always sophisticated, but tuneful and moderate in its emotional scope. One of the advantages the Collegium Musicum 90 has over other ensembles in this repertoire is its beautiful string tone. So many period instrument orchestras play with a steely, unpleasant string tone. The Collegium Musicum 90 plays with as crisp an attack and ensemble as any of them, but with a burnished, woody tone that seems totally appropriate to the music. The soloists on this CD all are good. The highlight, perhaps, is Standage's solo in the violin concerto, which he plays to intricate and elegant effect. The sound engineering is excellent, too. Altogether one of the best Telemann albums I know.",2

"This sword isn't the very best of all of my purchases made, however I am pleased with the purchase none the less. The sheath is made of medal and what appears to be plastic with a wooden look to it. Also like I've seen in many reviews the chain looks as if it could possibly break but I am not planning on using it as much more than an addition to my collection. The sword is beautiful, a little longer than the picture makes it look, but the description length is dead on. The grip is made of the same materials as the sheath but it is very sturdy. It is a beautiful piece and I would recommended it to anyone who isn't too serious of a collector. But over all it is very nice and I am satisfied with this purchase.",2

I really have no complains with this -- it smells great, my hair feels good afterward -- but it's no magic potion, I still need to style and style.The one thing you should be warned about it that this shampoo pushes the protein, it doesn't have anything in it to weigh your hair down. So if you have the crazy, puffy, curly hair like me, it'll get it healthy, but probably won't bring it under control. Otherwise, go for it",2

"I've been impressed by ""The Brick"" since day one. I bought this to replace my 18-55mm kit lens on my old T2i, and I honestly made the best decision. I've used this lens for landscape, portraiture, automobiles, product shot and even macro. This glass has delivered each time I've used it! Great focusing, very sharp, great contrast and color. Also provides great background blur and bokeh, which is another reason I bought this lens. I have used the 24-70mm L on a Rebel 550D, 60D, 7D, and 5DMK2. It works extremely well for each body, and will definitely cast the best quality each body can provide.

Why people compare Stone Temple to Pearl Jam and the likes of Nirvana is beyond me. I'm a fan of all three bands and neither one sound alike in major aspects. Sure, Do they resemble in musical arrangement, Possibly; But didn't all rock bands of the Grunge movement do so at the time? Pearl Jam and Stone Temple Pilots don't sound anything alike so I don't see why people have condemned them for that. Maybe it is just me, But I can distinguish between their musicianship greatly and they all have something different to offer. If you like good Rock, Get this album. I don't think that I need to run down the songs, As they have been broadcast all over the radio and MTV since the birth of the album. If you liked what you heard, Then that's STP.",2

Why Disney has stuff like that in its products I will never understand. At the end of the day this movie will mostly please little ones, which makes it all the more of a shame they have stuff like that in the movie.

The toy projects light, and the stars are just shadows, not the other way around. I feel this is backwards. 2. The light is not very strong, and the constellations and words are fuzzy & difficult to see, even in a small room. 3. The toy runs on batteries instead of electricity, and eats up batteries extremely fast (ours may have been defective, but it only ran for a few hours on one set of fresh batteries, repeatedly). 4. It was fickle. Sometimes it would turn on, and other times it would not. It would work with one set of batteries, but not another. 5. It's an inconvenient size and odd shape for its purpose.",0

Nowhere within the movie do the actors remind me that they are just actors--very convincing performances especially on the part of Sarsgaard and Christensen.

This was very disappointing to me. Why mess with a good thing?Before posting this review I decided to taste test the two.

This kind of comedy just has no place in our world. It is offensive to the point of inducing sickness.

"I bought this sub expecting great things, and overall I was disappointed. The sub does pack a lot of bass, but generally it's boomy, loose bass without real punch or control. The louder you turn it up the louder the boomy, hummy bass becomes, but it never transcends to the kick/thump you want. Also, and this is my biggest gripe with the unit, after a few months of use the amp started to die and now the sub makes a cracking noise any time it's in standby and sometimes even when it's on. It pops, snaps, and generally annoys me so much that I've replaced it with a Klipsch SUB-12 that goes MUCH lower and sounds much more controlled. It also has a lot more power for solid kicks. I think CerwinVega is just a name now, the quality is gone since the company was sold to the Stanton Group, a Chinese consortium that makes the subs at bottom dollar, slaps the CW name on them.

"I cook Korean food regularly but decided to check out some cookbooks for improvement. This book is a joke. Almost every recipe requires MSG (an unhealthy shortcut to authentic cooking). And almost every recipe requires Japanese products like Mirin and sake. Koreans take national pride in their food (developed over 5000 years) and repeated reference to the cooking style and ingredients of its recent past colonizer was rather offensive. The book also mentions dishes most Korean have never heard of; doesn't specify the time for certain steps; and uses ingredients that don't even grow in Korea or don't belong in the dishes. I think the book was geared to Japanese people who want to dabble in Korean cooking -- if you want to cook Korean food the way Koreans cook it, this book is not it.",0

Copying his paintings is very instructive. As is his former book Watercolor: Simple, Fast and Focused, this book is a gift to watercolorists and those who love looking at spontaneous, fresh paintings.Two other painter-authors who use this loose style for figures are Charles Reid and, for the nude figure, Douglas Lew (Painting from Life).",2

"Another colossal disappointment. Readers and seekers of factual evidence have a difficult time discovering reliable science, which this book does not represent. A scientist or researcher cannot have an agenda other than developing a fair postulate from sound facts. Good research includes all that is known first, and then confining tests to rigorous and sound analysis. Southerton does not do this, as so many pseudo scientists do. This kind of researching falls in the same category as Erich Von Daniken's ""research.""It's a real pity that people of any faith will cast their beliefs to the wind without first establishing the validity of an author's premise and examination methodology. They are however, of like minds, who look for an excuse to rationalize the abandonment of beliefs over a seemingly unsolvable conflict of ideas.",0

Along the way, he uncovers a plot where he is the subject to be silenced. Watch as Luke attempts to prevent an enormous disaster in the Cold War.",2

"If ""Fine and Mellow"" is Ella's best work from the 1970s, this 1975 recording is a close second. Although by the mid-70s her voice had lost some of its grace, she seemed to make up for that by imbuing the songs with an added intensity that wasn't evident on her earlier work. She's joined here by the legendary jazz pianist, Oscar Peterson, and by her ex-husband, bassist Ray Brown, and again she sticks with proven standards. This CD features a wide range of moods from the languid pace of ""More Than You Know,"" to the galloping ""I Hear Music."" The highlight, however, is the final cut, ""April in Paris."" For nearly eight wonderful minutes, Ella, Oscar and Ray have a field day with this classic tune.",2

"'Blood Brothers' is the excellent documentary showing the reunion of the E Street Band after 11 years apart and their recording of some additional tracks for Bruce's greatest hits album. Not only do I love the songs being recorded, but it is amazing to see them being performed and developed and the dynamic between all of the band members. You also get to see the music video recording for 'Murder Incorporated' which makes for a wonderful live performance and you can see just how much it means to all the fans and production crew there. This is the best place to go for an insight into Bruce when he is recording and to see how a song grows over subsequent takes and with band collaboration. This may be short, at just under 80 minutes, but it makes for riveting and inspiring viewing. Highly recommended for all fans of the boss.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",2

But what Hole seems to have evolved into is yet another generic pop group with a sexy sounding singer complete with guitars and drums. Don't get me wrong; Petals, Celebrity Skin, and other select songs still have a bit of that old Hole punch, but the rest sounds all alike.

"Hollywood's Spanish Black Legend in its most ridiculous shape. Unable -and unwilling- to learn anything about our contries, Tinseltown's screenwriters come up with their worst prejudices -dating back from the times of the Armada- to ""reenact"" the Conquest of Mexico. Cortez (CÃÂÃÂ©sar Romero, of all people!) enters the city of Cholulu (?), fights the Inquisition (!) and marches on to Mexico City to establish ""America"". There are plenty of colorful ""seÃÂÃÂ±orritas"", gay ""caballeros"", stoic indians, cruel inquisidors, saccharine friars and the ever-present ""latin looking"" hero with a greasy hairlock dangling from his brow. Only Carmen Miranda is missing! All Spaniards look like gypsies, all indians look like statues and Jean Peters seduces Tyrone Power dancing a ""zesty fandango"" at your usual nighfall ""fiesta"".

"I bought this leash for our 1-year-old Borador (Border Collie/Labrador Retriever mix) who is about 50 lbs. He loves the extra line he gets at the park without me having to worry about him running away. We have only had him for about 2 weeks and this is very necessary for training outside when he is ready for more distractions. Also a good way to play with him and run out all of his energy.The leash is fairly thin, but sturdy and seems generally well built. I only rated it a 4 star because it has kind of a rough texture in your hand which isn't the most comfortable. In fact my fiance wasn't paying attention and he took off running while she was loosely holding the leash. The leash gave her really bad rope burn and her fingers were all blistered for a few days. If you are going to use this leash just make sure you keep a snug grip on it, or wear some gloves to help protect your hands.Other than that it's a 50 ft leash which does it's job.",2

"Sorry, I did not get a thing out of this book, except that the author has struggled a lot and has a fairly negative attitude. He also believes in muses. (Guess if you don't feel on top of it, it's comforting to know there are muses out there.) Okay, maybe you believe in muses too. (If you do, you might like this book.) My good friend, whose opinion I value greatly, recommended it. He loved it. I didn't. We debate. I have better things to do with my time than read stories about how the author failed so many times before he reached a modicum of success, and then became a philosopher. So why do I take the time to write this review? Because I think you might spend your time better elsewhere. It's a small contribution; but, nonetheless, a contribution.",0

"Being only able to fumble my way around PhotoShop, I really wanted a book I could work with to learn this program. I've been getting more and more involved with digital photography and wanted to be able to work with my photos using more expertise. This book is perfect. The author structures her lessons starting with the basics so you're never overwhelmed. The lessons are also short enough so that I don't get bored from overload. I can work on it when I have a just a little time without feeling like I'm stopping in the middle. Chapters end with a short quiz so you know right away if you've grasped the concepts or not. The images the book refers to in the lessons can be downloaded from the Sams web site so you can do the actual exercises while you read through them. You're able to absorb what you're reading and walk away knowing that you're really learning PhotoShop.",2

They even gave me the latest model, but, it arrived dead, will not turn on. I'm calling them today.MSN said after I get my watch back, they would credit my down time. The person there agreed that Fossil watches are very problematic.I wish MSN would put some pressure on them to make their products reliable.

"What happened to rock goddess Courtney Love? She helped launch the riot grrl movement with L7 and Bikini Kill - and now she puts out an album that can easily get played between Madonna and Celine Dion on the adult contemporary stations. Sure enough, the other day when I was changing stations, I heard 'Malibu' on the local soft rock station. This totally lacks the intensity or emotion of Hole's early albums. The best songs on this album are actually not even as good as the worst songs on Live Through This. And don't even get me started on how trite the lyrics are! In short, if you like Madonna, Celine Dion or other soft rock artists, you will probably love Hole's new album. Anyone who bought and enjoyed Hole's first two albums should definitely avoid this like the plague. It's innocuous, bland and tame - the antithesis of what Hole was initially all about.",0

"Before this author ever wastes his time and money on another self-publishing (iuniverse.com publishes anything by anybody for a fee) effort he needs to listen to a few suggestions: First, he might have a good idea for a short story in this book, but there is no reason for him to stretch it into a tedious and boring novella, as he has done. Second, he needs a good editor, as I assume he published this book without one. His grammar is so poor it is distracting to any reasonably intelligent reader. This is doubly troublesome because his narrative is often so disjointed on its own, even without the grammatical flaws. He has sold many books in the Arcadia area based on the book's setting there, but because this one is so awful, a repeat of that success is unlikely.",0

She made her best friends Irina Krush look like a spoiled selfish brat and Elizabeth Vicary look like a sex digger. What people would write to sell a few extra books. Totally shameful!

"Elizabeth George is a great Bible study author. She helps you dig in to see what the Scripture really says, and asks great questions to make you think about your own life. She also challenges you to live out and apply the Book of James to everyday life. The homework may seem a little repetitious in some of the questions, but it does help to emphasize a central truth or point. The homework does not take a long time which is great for women who are on the go, or who don't have a lot of time to devote to doing the lessons (it also helps that the Scripture portions are included in each lesson so you can make notes by the Scriptures or do the lessons without having to use your Bible). I would really recommend this study, and others by Elizabeth George.",2

The only criticism: I have heard them live, and the CD sounds a bit ""studio"" compared to the high-energy live sound they generate. This is probably the most meaningful release from a Memphis artist or group in well over 10 years.Memphis has a few ""secrets"" like this, that don't get much recognition because they are not based on the coasts, and hopefully Voodoo Village will be one of the bands to change that.

Asleep cheerleading the march to war in the Middle East, and in so doing lost audience since he writes for the NY Times. So he turns back to globalization, and like a child that walks into the middle of a conversation, he's enthusiastic about everything. I read the book not as a review, but rather for interest in cultural developments. This book was like a UPS commercial. Friedman spans the globe and this is all the insight he brings back? What of China's communist government and its people? What of India with Hindus, their cast system, and social equality? How does India and China's business system really work? What about the progress and prospects of the former U.S.S.R block? As a 28 year old sales engineer, Friedman's book is useless in helping me find my way in this world.",0

I ordered another copy for my niece (10) for Xmas and i only ordered it a couple of weeks before the big day and was told it wouldn't arrive in time for Xmas, but would get here in the new year, i knew it would arrive though.It was posted through my letterbox 3 days before Xmas just like i knew it would be, so thank you very much Amazon :) Wonderful service as usual.Regarding the film it's a great story where Louise is a geek and when she turns 16 she gets some powers (cos she's a witch) so she uses these powers to put a spell on herself to make her the most popular girl at school!

That said, the case fits the GPS snugly and the clip stays on a belt or pack, so other than the soft screen it works as advertised.

Cleary also offers an in-depth overview of the history of this text, and its influence on Zen in Japan.With comments by two great Zen masters from opposites sides of the lineage chart (Hakuin from the Rinzai sect; Tenkei from the Soto sect). One is struck by the harmonious commentaries by two Masters representing sects that supposedly are diametrically opposed on their views and teachings of Zen Buddhism. Cleary once again finds the ""Universal Elements"" of Zen that transcend all schools and sects. An excellent guide to the most influential Zen Text of all time.",2

"Okay, first of all, I haven't heard all of this album, but I like everything I've heard off of it. Second of all, I have to say something about this comment on them being Godsmack ripoffs. This album came out way before Godsmack was even around, and it's backwards, the band is named after the song. Get the facts straight before you say something like that. Oh, and Alice in Chains is an awesome band. ""Rooster"" and ""Down in a Hole"" are wonderfully creepy. Godsmack is awesome too, but they took AIC's style, not the other way around.

So far I have had no issues with the lock rusting or being hard to open. The rubber casing on the lock helps to keep mud and dirt from getting into the internals of the lock, keeping it in good working order for longer.I also like the flap on bottom that covers the keyhole, as that is usually a common area for a lock to rust and get dirt in making the key hard to turn, so far I have had none of those issues. Another benefit is that all of the locks are keyed alike giving you the ability to use the locks in different places but only having to carry one key.Overall I would highly recommend this lock to anybody looking for something sturdy and that is going to withstand the elements better than a standard padlock.",2

Also, the booklet that came with it stated that the top won't support ANY weight which you won't find in the online description. Won't buy anything like this online again.

Having the split screen with the musicians in the past and live was so cleverly done. When Elvis turned around and mischieviously smirked at the other musicians you really could believe that he was actually performing live in this concert.I have been buying this concert as gifts because I really feel it will be a treasure in any DVD collection.

Instead, the first 35 minutes (of a 60 minute DVD) are a summary of all the albums of Deep Purple Mark II that lead up to the Made in Japan album. When the four narrators finally get around to discussing the Made in Japan album, they use concert footage from previous concerts (filmed in the US, Germany, and elsewhere) to illustrate their point about a certain song. The only Japanese footage included in this marginal DVD are a few cutaways of the Japanese crowd at a concert. And we don't really know if this footage is from the Deep Purple concert! Except for these few crowd shots, THERE IS NO CONCERT FOOTAGE OF DEEP PURPLE'S CONCERTS IN JAPAN ON THIS DVD.

I like how there are a series of joined subplots in each of his novels. That makes for a fast paced action story. Coupled with great characters, I find it difficult to put down.This is my favorite of his five novels just a bit more believable than the Day after Tomorrow. I hope that he has at least one more novel in him even though he has earned the retirement he is due.",2

"Saw this film in its entirety in a small theater in NYC in '97, about a year after its official release. Bought it on VHS a couple of years later, and then bought the DVD through Amazon. Overall, a interesting, if not very tragic documentary about an artist who was unique in her own way. Film is pretty direct in dealing with Nico's many issues & her self-destruction. Only small gripe about this release, is that certain movie segments with Nico in them (Ex: 'La Dolce Vita' & some clips from the Philippe Garrell movies) were removed from the time the theater version was shown & then its release on video/DVD...probably due to licensing issues, so film is short about 5 minutes.

"I liked the general sound of the group but better yet are the lyrics. songs that relly can touch you heart or leave you cold I like pretty well but it can't be compaired to Dc Talk their music is good in general but songs like the company car were funny once but twice was a bit much. it reminds me of Audio Audrenalin's underdog. they are good but not spectatular. I would recomend this album in general, but they do not have the same sparcle and perfection of Dc Talk. if your looking for good go to Dc Talk if you have that and are looking on look here. Dc Talk may be famouse but that is not unwarented, thier music is the best and that is it, I have found very few artest even in the secular comunity that can beet Dc Talk. This group they are hard enough to please but not absoloutly hard core. if your looking for something good this is relativly good but not wonderful beyond expectations.",2

I bought it because i'm in search of the perfect easy vacuum for stairs, well this definitely is NOT it. Spend less - buy the Boss - i've not found one better than it yet....and i've even shelled out [alot of money] for one of those German cordless vacs you see in some catalogs.

The events, what few there are, unfold in an uninspired way, the character development is non-existent. I stayed with it to the end, thinking the writer had some intention of turning the tables on us or making the story suddenly reverberate with new meaning -- no such luck. It was what it was -- repetitive and dull. The idea, however -- a man who nurses a lost love his entire life only to discover that his loyalty to the dead one has been based on a big lie -- it could have been worth reading. Pity that it wasn't.",0

"though I appreciate much of Winterson's novel-length work, I was wary in beginning this colection of short fiction edited by her. It started off with several interesting and pleasant to read stories, but as a whole, offered somewhat insipid, uninsightful writing. Perhaps this because I was expecting or hoping for a driving force of surreality and otherworldly characters who carried themselves strongly and had fully developed characteristics, much like found in The Passion or Sexing the Cherry. Unfortunately, I found the collection much more like The World & Other Places or Written On The Body--without much to pull me through and keep me reading. This book, in my opinion, is only for the Winterson connisseur.",0

"Normally inserted references to another work by the author make me cringe. Sawyer's throw-away reference to his book Illegal Alien however, made me sigh with the memory of a good book. Humans is undoubtably Sawyer's worst. The social satire is at best heavy-handed and preachy and at worst simply eye-glazing. If the satirist's weapon is the rapier, Sawyer uses a sledge hammer. The use of news clips is a familar device in Sawyer's writings, its abscence here is missed. I didn't really get a sense of how the world was reacting to the re-opening of the portal and relations with the Neanderthals.This book did give me a better insight into our own world however. After the upteenth time a Neanderthal criticized us I realized why our ancestors had wiped them out.",0

This prevents the watch from being used in water---which makes it worthless for his use. I frankly thought Timex did a better job on quality control...but as I stated, I did not inspect the watch when received. My advise to anyone purchasing this watch is to closely inspect it upon receipt.",0

The cinematography, the music (a disco rip-off of Clint Eastwood's Hang'Em'High)are just as great. Casanova Wong is quite a graceful and agile fighter in this one.I was VERY UPSET upon viewing this movie in DVD format in the states. It was like they used something worse than EP mode because the frame rate was EXTREMELY choppy. But if you are a die hard kung fu flick fan, I still have to recommend getting this for the movie's final moments. Yes, it is that good.

She writes with the same gentle Southern style as she does in this book. Her relationship advice is helpful and encouraging. For once, an author suggests how to deal with others kindly, gently, and like a lady without demeaning one's own character.",2

"... unless you really want to. And you better have good reasons in that case. I can't imagine what they could be though. If you want to ponder, circa 1988, the problems facing U.S. cities, or terrorism, or conspiracy, you'll not find anything much here. This is Franzen's first book, written 13 years before the materpice The Corrections (which is why you're considering this one, right?), and the kid had not yet assembled his talents nor adequately honed his intelligence. Rather than itemize its marginal successes against it's tedious failures, I'm gonna streamline for you: the only reason to give this a workout is to see how much the author, as a storyteller, truthteller, character-meister, has developed since. And that endevour is one of research. Read The Corrections again instead. Seriously.",0

"This slim volume packs more emotional punch than any ten books, art films, love songs, etc., that you will come across this year. Exploring the hope that waits behind loss, and the heartbreak that waits behind hope, this book will, quite simply, floor you once you read it. All three participants are people of immense courage -- photographer Simeon Hutner, for being able to stand behind the camera and capture the struggle of his family, his sister Elizabeth, whose poems eloquently describe not only the big-picture emotions of those faced with the unfairness of tragedy, but also the little details that make it that much more tragic, and finally her son, Sam, whose trusting, accepting, haunting gaze penetrates past the pages directly into our souls. It's an astonishing work of art, which moved me like few works have before. I highly recommend it to any and all... but you really have to be prepared for an emotional jolt when you pick this book up.",2

The production values are the best to be featured on a Throwdown album, and tracks like ""We Will Rise"", the title track, and ""To Live is to Sacrifice"" are straight ahead real hardcore cuts.

"A French Oven is a great gift for a man. You can make all sorts of manly meals in the French oven, with minimal know how. This is a real man's French Oven. Its a solid hunk of cast iron, heavily enameled in a real manly color, cobalt blue. I've had my French Oven for three years now, and it survived a trip to Afghanistan with me. I used it to cook all sorts of manly hunks of lamb and beef over a propane stove over there. It was indispensable. This French oven heats evenly, and doubles as a real manly piece of gym equipment, should you be lacking that. Clean up is a breeze with this particular model, and you can use rough scouring pads on it without damaging it, unlike your more feminine teflon coated models. Be a man and scrub your pot after you make your hearty stews! It could also serve as body armor or a makeshift shield in a pinch. Hurrah!",2

"He has the first amendment right to write his books, and you have the right to ignore them.He claims he was in prison because the government didn't like what he was saying about the medical profession and pharmaceutical companies.

The following year, he also pleaded guilty to credit-card fraud in federal district court in Boston, resulting in prison term of nearly two years.

"Leaks__!, October 19, 2008By Valerie A. Jones ""She who reads a lot"" (Virginia Beach, VA USA) - See all my reviewsThis is very frustrating--I wish I'd read more of the reviews here to learn that this blender leaks.We've used it almost every day for a month. Even when we think it's assembled as tight as can be, it still leaks. When re-assembling it, I've taken to blending soapy water first--if THAT leaks, it's not such a mess. If it's ""safe,"" then I blend the smoothies. Smoothies are a lot messier to clean up.What a hassle. Not worth $200 at this point--if it didn't leak it might be, as the blending power is better than average.",0

"At some point, I too came to realize that the world is flat. Now I know why. Thomas Friedman eliminates any doubts of such a phenomenon with an abundance of evidence and case studies. Even his own theories and ideas are not free from the scrutiny of the data gathered by his research.What makes this book different from many other books that ""report"" the current state of affairs is that Friedman actually provides answers to problems that he identifies. He does a comprehensive job containing the idea of globalization in its current stage along with providing reasonable steps in dealing with and facilitating the inevitable flattening of the world.""The World is Flat"" offers a wealth of information that I think satisfies a much required calibration of many of our sights to improve the clarity and accuracy of the way we perceive the world. Hence, allowing us understanding and perhaps benefit from a flattening world.",2

I'm not sure when I think about it why I got this book. I would only recommend this book for a straight woman or a straight leaning bisexual woman, especially if she has a foot fetish.

"Have you ever bought one of those CD's that you JUST CAN'T stop playing, no matter how hard you try? Well, Switchfoot's new CD ""Learning to Breath"" is just one of those CD's. I've been playing it constantly for the last three weeks and I'm still hearing new things...it's THAT kind of disc. ""Learning to Breathe"" is full of the kind of amazing songs and sonic surprises that sneak up on you and take you by surprise, taking you to places you would have never imagined they would. Consider the subtle beginnings of ""I dare you to move"" and the way they climax in an incredible roar...and the powerful crunch of ""You already take me there""...and the smirky ""metal lounge"" effect on ""Poparazzi"" and it will be clear that these guys are onto something really good here.

I have read all of KSR's previous books and have always been able to get past some of his more meandering passages. Not this time! He really lost me in the first half of the book somewhere in the park. Irrelevant subplots and characters were very distracting.

I will not be reading the next installment.,0

I have to admit that the book did discuss too much of the ""whys"" of messiness, but if you can get past the first part of the book, you will be surprised that the second half of the book provides just as much of the ""hows"". I have read quite a few de-cluttering and organizational books, which have been very helpful, but this one has helped in a way that none of the others have been able to. I have been struggling with a messy house for the last 13 years, and after 3 months, my home is organized! I've tried lists and time schedules and they just don't work for me. However, the ""flipper"" idea in the book works like a charm! It helped me from getting overwhelmed by distributing small jobs over a period of a month. Cooking and grocery lists are much simpler now also. If you are sick of having a home that you are embarrassed to show your guests, read this book!",2

"Here we have one of those choices between great sound and great performance. This 1950 broadcast is wonderful, yes, but there is little humor in the performance; only Cloe Elmo as Dame Quickly sounds like she's having any fun. On the other hand, the astounding 1937 Salzburg performance--now newly-remastered with quite acceptable sound (see: Toscanini - The Salzburg Experience, Vol. 4, Falstaff)--has life, wit and whimsy along with outstanding singing. Also, Dino Borgioli, the Fenton on the Salzburg set, is the best on records, while the singer in this 1950 performance is quite terrible.If you want a good performance you will listen to a few times, buy this version. If you want a timeless performance that will reveal new hidden beauties every time you put it on, spend the extra $10 for the ""Salzburg Experience.""",0

"Blind Justice was my first exposure to James Scott Bell, and I have to say I was impressed. While there were definitely a few places he could have ""upped"" the suspense, overall it was a good story. I read it over the course of two days and found it hard to put down once it really got started. Some folks don't appreciate his comparisons to John Grisham, but I consider it a compliment for him. If you are into legal thrillers, then this is definitely one you'll want to pick up. The very concept of a lawyer having a mentally handicapped client who swears the devil came into the room and killed his wife should be enough to keep most readers hooked (I know it was enough for me). The ending is good, and the main character's evolution from start to finish is believable. All in all, I recommend this one. It was definitely good enough to warrant reading another one of his books.",2

"This potent little book may not be for someone approaching old age and death timidly or for the young and still immortal. It pulls back the curtain and reveals the nasty fact that, as we may be identified by our professions in our prime, in old age, we are the sum of our physical afflictions, and everyone is in for it.The book takes about two hours to read, and it's Roth story-telling stripped down to the bare essentials. He is feeling his own mortality, and, being a writer, is getting it off his chest with the tools that fit his hand best.Readers who allow themselves to be distracted by the fact that the protagonist cheated on his wives and made some bad marital decisions are either trying to lessen the impact of what Roth is telling them or just miss the point. It's like pretending that the New York Trade Center disaster is not as bad as it could be because some of the fatalities were people who cheated on their wives or on their income taxes.",2

"If you are looking for a solid review of the HIPAA Security Rule, I would suggest looking elsewhere.

The frameworks for assessing Security Policicies and Procedures are nearly non-existent.

"this package of Plan 9/ Robot Monster is GREAT!Excellently transferred to DVD. The added bonus of the documentary of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", is fascinating. See Ed Wood directing in rare film clips.""Plan 9""(I guess the first 8 failed) is very fun , and amazingly inept. But Wood, bless his big heart, was sincere and honest, and a bit naive......and the result is one of history's most hilariously bad movies, ever. But very entertaining.As far as ""Robot Monster"" goes......you have to see the hairy beast with the diving-helmet with the TV antennae and the soap bubbles and the flavin........he just wiped out all of the entire race except for a few survivors, who just happen to live a few yards from his cave.yes, the acting, script,and special effects stink, but at least the direction is horrible! this movie is hilarious, and very entertaining.So.....a great double feature for you big kids out there!",2

"My 6 year old daughter had not had a dry night in over two years. After one week of using the alarm, she had her first dry night. During the second week of using the alarm, she was dry every other night. Since then, she has not had a single accident and has been dry for over two months straight!The ultimate with options was nice because we could select the sound that she liked (there is one that sounds like a telephone that she liked best--some of the others were a little scary to her). My daughter did not like the vibrations, so we just turned that option off after the first night. I had put off purchasing an alarm thinking that she would eventually outgrow the problem, but I don't believe that it would have happened any time soon without the alarm. The process was much quicker than I could have ever imagined and my daughter is so proud of herself now and so much more confident. It was the best $[...] I have spent in a long time!!

This cleaner is very easy to use and works well - It is a little heavy to move around but only when full of water (and if the tanks were smaller you'd have to keep refilling - so better to be heavy than have to refill every few mins. and I guess you could fill it half way if it was a big deal). The biggests downside is the brushes underneath. They are round spinners and the are are turned by one of the brushes so I'm waiting for that to break and the rotating brushes to stop working. Best part about the machine is the suction - it has a strong suction and leaves the carpet fairly dry.,2

There were some days that it would take me 10 minutes to lock or unlock. Every time it rained the metal inside would seem to rust and the new ware caused it to become even harder to use. Finally, today I went to lock up my bike, and the key just broke off in the lock. There is absolutely no way to get it out so my spare key was useless. Now I have an expensive bike on a rack outside at night because it happened after most stores closed, so I need to get a new lock hoping it my bike doesn't get stolen tonight, because the key broke in it before it locked.

At one point you're just getting into the exercise, and it cuts to the Crunch logo without warning and a whole other segment begins. The background people know the routine better than Billy does, as he's often standing there talking while the group continues with the workout. He also stops once or twice to show off his own moves and encourages his group behind him to do so as well. It's a good workout if you don't mind the choppy editing and lack of cueing on Billy's part. You really have to apply yourself and fill in the blank spots in this workout (NO pun intended).",0

If you are shocked that your once competent loved one is no longer who they used to be and you worry that caregiving is coming your way, you will receive insight and understanding. If you are a, now known as ""caredfor,"" you will realize what your care providers, caregivers, are going through. If you are a healthcare provider, you will gain deeper compassion and tools to better help the patients you treat.

This film is so anti-Christian and so wrong on so many levels,it gives a very twisted view of a very good grassroots faith-one that is the foundation of our great country. In the light of the Messiah-fication of Barack Obama,I find it strange that the movie includes a scene of a cardboard cutout of George W. Bush being worshipped by children.I guess Obama hadn't descended from the clouds yet,because i've NEVER seen someone so praised & worshipped in my entire life as Obama has been-and for no good reason.THAT is what's scary.",0

Definitely worth it and they are on my keeper shelf. The characters are great and you really feel like you know them and the sex is Hot! Two things I expect from a good book and so far this series has been one of the most enjoyable series I've read since the Promises series by Sarah McCarty. While this series is contemporary and not historical like the Promises series to me each of these wild book's are fantastic! A Must Read!,2

I have used Avery Design pro for a few years already and really did like the things it did.However - for some unknown reason the old (free) program I was using quit working. It was not a demo it came on a disc that I got inside of Avery products I purchased some years ago.Long story short....The new program will not install.After many weeks of working with Avery and Microsoft the only explination is - my installer has a problem.Funny thing is - I have loaded other programs and they worked fine.The last possible cure mentioned so far is - DUMP THE SYSTEM completely and reboot. That sounds drastic to me so I will keep trying to repair the problem.Too bad for these delays.I already have a folder full of saved short cuts with Avery. My wife's quilt club needs some of these things done again. Have no way to replace them without going through it with a picture program that does not work very well.FrustratedRichard M.,0

"i had never seen this show before but because it was so popular I decided to get the first three seasons. I usually won't spend this much if I can help it but something told me 'go for it.' I am so glad I did. Parenthood is about one big extended family, white, black, Jewish, Catholic and their trials and tribulations. It is full of heartwarming moments as well as funny with witty dialogue and unbelievably well written. After seeing seasons one and two I couldn't wait to see season three and it was everything I thought it would be. You will recognize some of the actors from other shows (Six Feet Under, Coach, Gilmore Girls, etc) and they are cast perfectly. Do not hesitate to buy this season and the other two for they are well worth it. If I like a show I often go back months later and watch it all over again and this was one of those series. Great cast, fabulous storylines; lots of laughs and tears. It doesn't get better than this!!!! I can't wait for season four!!",2

Without this, it was sticking a lot and the belt would come out of its track. Having figured this out, I was excited to see some final results, but nothing good to say there. While it seemed to go through the first few weeks of course and fine grit with decent results and improvements, we NEVER got to a final product that is shiny and nice. They are dull. Only obsidian type rocks (glass like to begin with) look nice. I tried double washing, extending the final polish, lighter loads, etc. to no avail. 3 full month long polishes and no nice rocks.I would NOT recommend this product at all. I'm looking for an upgrade!",0

It works very well at keeping my child off the TV 24/7. The thing that I hate about it is that it has some kind of sensor that turns Bob off when the TV is turned off.

I had an oneida set prior to this one that I had for 8 years and this never happened. I would not recommend this flatware to anyone. The more they get washed in the dishwasher the more it starts to rust. Very disappointed and surprised in the poor quality of this flatware.,0

If there's anywhere the album fails, it's the lyrics which at times recall Paul's worst. But for the better part of the album they are at least tolerable and sometimes quite good. They do hold the album back from being a true classic, though. They don't really hurt the album very much, just hold it back a bit. I have been listening to it all week and like it more and more. The best songs are Friends to Go, English Tea, Too Much Rain and Promise to you Girl. The others are also good, but not quite. Overall, a return to better days for Paul and highly recommended.",2

Purchased these chairs for the new dining room table. I loved the look and the color is what I wanted but the quality is very cheap. They are very light weight. I feel like you can just walk by and it will tip over. Some of the chairs legs are uneven and wabble. One of the chairs doesn't glide when you push in the chair you actually have to tilt it back in order to push it. It's gets caught on the rubber on the bottom leg. Will have to see how the cushion on the chairs last. It's only been a few days since we started using them. Also the faux lether is poor quality as well. These will have to do until I can purchase better ones. Buyer be ware you get what you pay for.,0

"Nice gauge -- comes with a zipper carrying pouch. Using the gauge takes a bit of practice because the hose flops around -- it's definitely a two-hand operation. Once the gauge is firmly clipped to the tire stem, however, getting very accurate inflation pressures is simply a matter of using the bleed valve to slowly reduce the tire pressure to exactly what you want (assuming you slightly over-inflated the tire to begin with). Personally, I would have preferred a rigid connector to the tire as opposed to the flexible hose. And, don't depress the ON-OFF button too long because that causes the gauge to switch between psi and BAR. Now that I have this gauge I'm thinking: do I really need to know my tires' pressures to an accuracy of 0.1 psi? Think about it before buying -- I should have.",2

"This book is filled with beautiful illustrations and incomplete explinations.

In my opinion he should concentrate on trying to teach the information instead of trying to impress the reader with how much he knows...and you DON'T! And how about the type errors...too many to go into. The editor should proof read his work before sending it to press...but then he doesn't really need to because on the 4th page of the book is a disclaimer stating that this book is ""AS IS"" and that they don't take responsibility for the book's accuracy or completeness. I wouldn't want to be responsible for this book either! Well, that's my personal opinion...take it for what you will.Very Disappointed.",0

I've read several Ken Follett books and he is in top form with Code to Zero. It's written very well with developed characters and an intricate plot with some surprising twists. You get a real sense of the 1950's and the space race during that time. The repeated snippets during the story of counting down the rocket on the pad with all the technical details really added to the book's depth and created tension and suspense. I'd rank this as one of Mr. Follett's best books. A definite must read.,2

"We've had this timer for about five years and I am on Amazon now shopping for a new one. We've liked the styling and functionality of this timer's various features and modes, but it has one fatal flaw: the buttons often do not respond to your touch, requiring two or three pushes of the button for a response. Perhaps this design flaw has been fixed on newer models, but on our timer, every single button requires the user to be extra vigilant and diligent about making sure your button-push 'took.' It's especially hard to get the timer to respond when you have to push TWO buttons simultaneously, as when you are clearing the previous time in the 'stopwatch' mode.I don't mind having to fiddle with this timer when I have the time, but on some critical applications where seconds count (film development in days of yore), this is not the timer you want to be using.",0

The band starts jamming on one tune only to segue into another tune.If the video direction was done right (keep it simple) then I would rate this DVD as 4 stars. Buy at your own risk!",0

"This is the best in the RE series yet. It looks wonderful on Dreamcast. Clear and fluid graphics with solid gameplay. The ability to use 2 weapons in 2 different directions is a new feature that has really added to gameplay and gives the player an opportunity to make it safely through tight situations. It is a must buy, if you have a new Dreamcast make this one of your first games!",2

"I am very excited about reviewing this CD because all the songs albeit 3 were suggested by me. I had written to Disky complaining that EMI & Disky are releasing the same old songs when there are so many songs by Shirley still unreleased on CD. You can imagine my joy when I saw this CD because now I can throw away my worn-out vinyl.The songs are indeed glorious from ""Pieces Of Dreams"" to ""If We Only Have Love"". I guess they had to include ""Something"", ""Never Never Never"" & ""This Is My Life"" which you can find on all Shirley's CDs BUT at least the mix they selected for ""This Is My Life"" is the rare European single version. An absolutely great CD and not just because I chose the songs!",2

"This is a great album, that got mixed reviews when it was released back in 94. It was a moderate hit selling over a million copies world-wide, but you can't help and get the feeling that it was a bit over-hyped. The songs on the album are all awesome, but the real gem on the album is The Comfort of Strangers. It's too bad this recording wasn't taken seriosly, but what can you expect when you play it on 90210? Jamie is currently working on some new music, very different from the one on this album. Expect to hear about Jamie and his band elco. soon.",2

"This is an excellent product and certainly recommend it. However, the included configuration software for Windows XP is not easy to use.

This was surprising to me considering this is an Apple product. Nevertheless, I would still recommend this product.",2

The baby seems to enjoy the music feature. The toy is completely ignored by the baby. It's a good playard (I trust Graco products), but a simpler model would have been better.",2
