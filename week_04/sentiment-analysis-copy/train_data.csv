I ordered this online because no one around town had this and we needed it for a trip coming up for the weekend. Not only did it arrive two days before we left but it was 3$ cheaper to buy online + 2-Day shipping (which got here in 1 day). The mattress is great and our 3 yr old loves it. The mattress protector is just a fleece fitted sheet and nice to have and having the air pump and the carry bag is a life saver as well. Setup and put up is simple and takes a couple of minutes at most. Highly recommend this product for your toddler(s).,2

"I picked up this book happy to read that someone had the courage to tackle the issues of the working poor. Sadly, this book misses and misses dreadfully. Ms. Newman spent years of research and it comes across that she sat in her academic office and never had the guts to go into the neighberhoods she represents in her book. She blames the poor for most of their problems instead of the companies who pay wages that aren't livable. Why didn't she write a book about companies that feel it's ok to pay someone $5.00 and hour and expect them to survive in life. How can we as humans think this is acceptable behavior. If her so called Burger Barn cut some of it's profits and gave it to the workers, just think you'd have happy encouraged workers and billionaires who maybe can't buy a new plane that year.",0

"Just another example of Mr. Lindberg's pitiful attempt at exhibiting a strong expertise on a subject with which he is clearly obsessed. Don't waste your time with this book, either. It is poorly written and fails to engage the reader. You might consider using this book and the first book he wrote on the same subject, as a pair of bookends. That is about all they are worth.",0

We've had this feeder for a year and have had good success attracting hummingbirds with it. The bright red color apparently does a good job luring them to our window. It's a little inconvenient to clean but I don't mind because my wife does it.We have it hanging on a hanging device attached to a deck rail in front of a window. The only problem with this set up is that I can barely see the hummingbirds who invariable decide to perch on the opposite side of the feeder.Watching the hummingbirds is a joy. It might be a good idea to add a water baffle to the top to discourage ants. It really works.,2

I'm a huge Earth Crisis fan and if you wanna hear them tearing away at some older songs this is it. It maybe nothing new but it sure is intense as far as the covered material goes.",2
