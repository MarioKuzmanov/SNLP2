"""Chandler"" is a film with a terrific cast - Warren Oates, Charles McGraw, Gloria Grahame, Royal Dano, Scatman Crothers, Richard Loo, Mitch Ryan - but it never gets off the ground. Director Paul Magwood (1943) complained that MGM re-cut the film and changed the music, but that's only half the problem. The other problem is that the scenes themselves are dull and lackluster, regardless of how you cut them, and regardless of the heavy handed music score that was not uncommon for early 70s action films.BTW - Magwood was married to co-star Leslie Caron. This was Magwood's first film and only film as a director. His later career was built around work on TV as an assistant director for B TV movies and series (""Nero Wolfe"", Mike Hammer"", ""Father Dowling Mysteries"").Those of you, like me, who love Warren Oates films (""The Wild Bunch"", ""Badlands"", ""Ride the High Country"", ""Dillinger"", ""Bring me the Head of Alfredo Garcia"") will be disappointed.",0

So did the hospital, Mercy General, even with all of the construction going on which was a little too much. I am very much into NDE's so the ending was very disappointing and I did not like the way it was all wrapped up. But I did learn a thing or two about the medical view of NDE's and I still disagree with it. I felt that the author tried to discredit NDE's and she ruined the entire concept for me in the ending. It should have been more uplifting. There was no closure at the end. So, all in all, two stars were knocked off the rating because of the crappy end.",0

I could not get it to install correctly on my Toshiba Portege tablet. 5 hours and 4 technical support calls, all to no avail. I cannot get it to save the motion settings with the Logitech software. Uninstalling the Logitech software and using the MS XP drivers corrects that problem but at the cost of not being able to use several of the buttons on the mouse. And even the buttons that work don't work on all of my applications.To make matters worse, the technical support people, in addition to being unhelpful, were impatient. One of them tried to blame Microsoft, their ""competitor."" I'm no fan of MS but, damn, if you're making a mouse, shouldn't you make it compatible with the operating system that 95% of the world uses?

There is a great deal to be said about the drama of ordinary life, but I don't see any of it here. Take a look at some other Pulitzer Prize winners instead of this one: Annie Proulx, Richard Russo's ""Empire Falls,"" and even Marilynne Robinson's flawed ""Gilead"" have much more intelligent things to say about life lived out of the fast lane, and are much more poignant and memorable than this bickering couple standing on the side of the road.",0

I have about a dozen of the Millennium Collection discs in my house, and even though they're fairly skimpy, I've been quite impressed by the sound quality on these discs. This one bucks that trend, and more.I have never heard such poor sound reproduction on a disc that is supposedly ""24-bit mastered from the original master tapes"". It sounds like I've thrown a thick wool blanket over my speakers. I have ""Whatcha Gonna Do?"" on a compilation CD from the early 90s, and it sounds MUCH better on the old disc than on this one. Either the master tapes have deteriorated significantly in the last few years, or Jim Phillips (the poor schlup responsible for mastering this mess) has to go back to sound school.I would give four stars for the decent tunes (pretty much all the ones you would expect are there), but major deductions for lousy sound!",0

I really liked some orangish-gold paper I found in Staples once, but there appears to be no mention of its existence anywhere online under the Gold Fibre name.

I have to admit the price is the first thing that caught my attention. So I started to read the reviews and found good and bad reviews, more of them good then bad. So I decided to buy the backpack and when it came in I was dissapointed. The saying is true that you get what you pay for. I like the layout of the backpack, it had plenty of room and pockets. The padding was not very thick and seemed like there was no protection if I was to bump into something. The bottom line is, I didn't feel safe putting my camera in this bag. So I did more research and bought a KATA R-102. The moral of the story is, Don't skimp on the bag after you've already spent a couple thousand on a camera!",0

"It's refreshing to hear a composer finally write in an idiom that you normally only find in music that is either written for film or by one of the long departed masters of the last century. Waring's music is both accessible to a popular audience and compelling enough to make you want to come back to it over and over. Especially moving is the Bosnian Overture, which is remeniscent of early Mahler and Prokofiev. The piano concerto is a little more Neo-classical in style, very traditional. The Mountains of Tolima is a beautiful celebratory piece with wonderful latin american and spanish overtones in both orchestration and construction. I would say this CD is definately worth checking out!",2
"I laughed. I cried. I was genuinely moved to get my life closer to God. It is an awesome movie with an awesome message. Anyone who claims to be a Bible-believer or a Christian must see it. It was a totally clean movie - something sorely lacking among today's movies (no foul language, no fornication, no alcohol, no drugs, and no criminal violence). It just goes to show that you don't need big name actors or a huge budget to make a great movie. If a small church in south Georgia can pull this off, then hopefully it will inspire other non-Hollywood, family friendly entities to do the same. Don't let the PG rating fool you - just some secular progressive liberals upset about ""too much God"" in their opinion. Anything that puts Biblical Christianity in a positive light will be offensive to them.",2

"While not much is written about the Boxer Rebellion, Diana Preston, does a great job. I could not put this down, it reads like a novel. Preston vividly re counts the events leading up to the rebellion, as well as the conflict itself. The discription of the charaters in the same detailed light (the sexual habits of the players is also mentioned, but not over done)places a face on the conflict. It also descibes the awkward union of the world powers that sent troops to rescue the legations in Peking. What I noted the most is that in some aspects China has changed very little. The maps and pictures help with the story. I liked this book very much, and being an avid history reader I could not tell if this was a novel or a history book. If you are looking for a great read that covers this period (in which so few books are written) buy Preston's book.",2

Celine's ""from the heart"" music added zest to this work of art. The DVD topped it all off. I liked how they let us see how the work came about!It is a must book for all mothers.",2
"the opening credits turned me off a bit but the rest of teh story carries you along quite nicely. I was realy surprised with how engaging the format was and how entertaining it was too. yes Adam Savage is in it but he's notthe ""star"" so don't watch it just for that. watch it becasue its an engaing and intersting movie that provides a good think.",2

"This item is a rip-off. First, I purchased it to record my favorite HBO shows because I work late. Well, it doesn't record HBO. Second, when I does record a show the DVD recorder takes up to 10 minutes to finalize the DVD and the loss of quality compared to my regular signal is huge. This didn't happen with my less expensive ""Lite-on"" brand recorder. I guess I should've and will purchase a lower priced item from the competition. Most DO record the shows I need, they record faster and they give me, the consumer to decide if I should or not copy certain shows. Sony is out of my dictionary.",0

If you're going professional you should look at the S series. But if you want a camera you could carry around (in your shirt pocket!)just to hang out with friends or go on a vacation without having to lugg all this equipment with you, this is the perfect camera. I've had it for about 6 months now (I even dropped it once =I) and it's working perfectly.The only drawback is the little flash circles it makes whenever I take a picture while others are flashing.

There are two problems with this mouse - first, the motion was jerky, it seemed to be trying to do the smart thing and go to hyperlinks and buttons, even when I had the setting turned off. I might have worked more to fix this, except for the second problem - it won't work if you're left handed.If you are left handed, don't bother. The mouse seems to fit into my hand, but because of the different angle at which a left hand holds the mouse, straight up and down became a diagonal line, and straight left and right curved down.

"I enjoyed the first 2 novels in the witness series a lot. This one was kind of redundant and was all over the place. The book didn't seem to flow as the others did. The author established that Matthew and Josie had a history, but in the novel made it seem as this was something Archer should be threatened by but there were no lead ins to this. There were no clues or events given that illustrated that Matthew and Josie were interested in one another at the current time. The novel also was quite disjointed. A lot of the events happened with no suspense or details to lead up to it. All in all I did not enjoy this read as much as the first 2 novels in this series.",0

I grew up in the Seattle area and have been a Nirvana fan since first hearing them back in 1990. I thought the book had a lot of exaggerations in it to paint Kurt Cobain as being a punk rocker since his birth in 1967. It was also very 'Courtney friendly'. The author was obviously a huge Nirvana fan and I think the book was written from that perspective rather than from an objective one. Biographies are usually better coming from an unbiased biographer.,0
"When the film was first released, a lot of people didn't understand it. It was like other films they had seen before, just a rehash of older material. Wrong!

My recommendation is this: IF you are a woman, mother and/or daughter, best friend, friend, married, divorced, widowed, a parent or single...you will love this book.

Books like this make me wonder why some terribly written books sell millions by getting onto Opera's lists and others that are equally accessible literally get sidelined. The encouraging thing is that you can STILL buy it, so do it now!I guess I need to back up a step and say that I am not saying this belongs on the Top 100 books of the century or anything like that. But if you read more than five books of fiction a year, this is a book that is a good read and very original in how the common revolution theme brings life and death to specific every-day individuals.",2

I have long, medium texture hair with natural wave and this brush styles it beautifully. I use it after I've blown my hair out and it provides perfect loose curls/waves that stay for hours. I have one for home and one for my office. It heats up very fast and is perfect for quick touch ups. After about one year, one of them doesn't heat up as much, so I'll have to replace it, but at this price, who cares? Also, I brought this to Europe and the UK with me and it worked perfectly with a plug converter! Btw, this is for the larger size barrel, not the 0.75 inch.

I ordered this item because I remembered having a cheese slicer quite some time ago and loved being able to get wafer thin slices of cheese. The board part of the slice is smooth and manageable. The slicer came with an extra wire secured to the bottom of the slab. My only issue with the slicer is that the groove into which you slice the cheese is a bit rough which makes cleaning slightly more difficult than I remember. The handle and attached wire will also slide a little forward during the downward motion of the slice which can lead to some inconsistent slices but all in all well worth the price.,2

All these years, after the Beatles split up, some people are just trying to convince themselves (and the world) that there is still good music to be made. And there is.

"I had a hard time with this book. I started out liking it, and I do 'get it', but I cannot agree with the overall conclusion of the book: that the book of revelation is simply a book applicable for any time in history where persecution and compromise are widespread. As I search through several different bibles, look at the world today in light of history, and search my own feelings about what John was actually writing about and to whom, I am struck with the overwhelming conclusion that the revelation was and is anything but a kind of fuzzy, nonspecific book of the bible. Far from it. It takes more than scholarly logic to understand it. It takes faith. Either you 'see the signs of the times' or you have closed your eyes to the obvious. This was one of my main problems with the book.Nonetheless, if you have the patience, it may be a different perspective worth reading about, if only to see a 'possibly' incorrect interpretation.

"This book, like others in the O'Leary series I've used, is geared for College study. As such, it's quite thorough, with various kinds of tests & projects at the end of each tutorial chapter.The O'Leary series are also virtually free of errors. My first (good) experience of the O'Leary series was at college where I learned far more just using the book, than in class. If you need to learn Word2000, get this book--it's probably the most effective tutor available. Expensive, but you get what you pay for.While this is the Introductory Edition, it goes way beyond what the introductory edition of another series goes. The last two chapters cover using Word2000 to create a web site, and `Working Together`--linking documents, sending documents via email and using Word2000 to collaborate in the creation of documents.",2

With a loud booming baseline that defines the hardhouse genre coupled with a melodic breakdown everpresent in modern trance and a '100 wasps in a tin can' techno build up this single track spans the three most popular dance genres. This track is now a club classic with the instantly recognisable 'gonna getcha ... covered in slime' build up and deep booming climax. Will appeal to lovers of the three genres mentioned above and probably many other clubbers. Pure class!,2

He claims we are all mere constructs of his higher power, yet he is writing this book in order to help us (his fictional characters ) rearrange our reality, which, by the way, would have been made up by him as well anyway. I guess he could argue that we (or I, cause you don't exist either) made him up in order to help myself, but it seems that he is pretty sure he exists. Confused? I hope so because this premise is ridiculous.This book is one big ""what if?"" model of reality with little logic and absolutely no factual basis for its premise.

I like Jennifer's book a lot. She did her research and gave a very candid view about women's chess. The reason why I gave this a 4 star and not 5 is there're some factual errors. The most glaring one is Judit Polgar did play in women's tournaments after the 1990 Olympiad. She competed in the 1992 Women's World Rapid and Blitz Championship but did not win. You can find this fact at the Judit fan club website. There are a few other minor ones but overall it's a good book. This is a well done job by Jennifer.,0

"I haven't finished the book yet. I am determined to do so. But I find it tough to muddle through the obvious agenda which is to lay the blame for eugenics on liberal Christians, those who advocate for a social gospel, in other words, ""not really Christian."" This message is so heavy handed in the introduction, the afterword and the first two chapters, that her other points are lost. I am a special educator, very interested in the eugenics movement and expected a historical record. I was promised interesting character portrayals. Instead, so far, I get a condemnation of liberal Christianity. It is getting very old. I will try to persevere. Part II: I trudge painfully on. I ran a word search with my Kindle. The author uses the word liberal over 80 times. This is not a history of eugenics. If you knew little about the subject, you would probably be confused. This is a hatchet job on Liberal Christianity.",0

"This is my favorite DIJ album, too. ""Rose Clouds"" was a good follow-up, but this album is the stronger of the two.

""Little Black Angel"" is a classic, but my personal favorite is ""The Golden Wedding of Sorrow."" It sounds like one of the most cheerful, serene ditties ever. Death in June pulled that trick often. It works.""But, What Ends..."" is the dominant twin of their two ""Apocalyptic folk"" releases. If you like Legendary Pink Dots, Sol Invictus or Current 93, Get This Album.

"I recently discovered Madeline Hunter; I find her hit and miss - By Arrangement was very good, The Rules of Seduction a waste of paper I could not be bother to finish. The Romantic is a clear example of her good writing and thoughtful plotting and details, but it's a fundamentally boring story. Penelope is sweet and it seems not much else as I can't name a single other thing about her two days after finishing the book. She has a terrible husband, has proto-feminist desires for marital equality, then eagerly consents to a marriage under the same yoke of ownership and dependence, although since Julian is a good guy I guess it's okay to participate in an institution she (only hours ago) abhorred. Yawn. The ending was a deus ex machina that tied everything up nice and pat, also very boring in a story that attempts to be compelling. When I find a good book I can't put it down; this book has dozens of pages folded over from where I stopped because I had more interesting things to do.",0

"Mravinsky is the prime exemplar of a faster performance tradition of Shostakovich's Eighth Symphony, presumably countenanced by the composer himself. This is in direct contrast to modern interpretations advocated by the Russian conductors Mstislav Rostropovich, Dmitri Kitayenko and Rudolf Barshai, as well as AndrÃÂÃÂ© Previn. But there is more to a performance than tempo. Mravinsky generates a nearly manic intensity in the third movement that no one has matched, and, despite his generally fast tempos, effectively communicates the power and suffering inherent in Shostakovich's anti-war masterpiece. As a pure performance this rates five stars, but the mediocre sound and atrocious audience noise make it a four star recording which should nevertheless be in the collection of anyone seriously interested in the music of Shostakovich. Arthur B. Lintgen",2
"Jan Smith continues her winning ways from her first CDTin Heart. ""Woman Your Guitar"" sets your toe to tapping with its down-home acoustic beat & tongue-in-cheek lyric about the importance of music, ""Don't give a woman a guitar that you want back; Don't give her all your records in a stack; She will learn Big River & she'll start wearing black."" ""Rum in My Morning Coffee"" has song tasty twanging guitar by Johnny Hiland with Jan's seductive lyric, ""A little vodka in my tonic, a little song to help me sleep; I'll take the time that silence buys 'cause nothing satisfies me like you."" David Talbot's banjo and the lovely melody make ""Simple Path to Freedom"" a gem. The CD concludes with country swing on the spunky ""True Love,"" ""Don't be slow; don't you turn on no TV show; I've got a yearning, baby, don't you know, Oh I could be your true love."" ""29 Dances"" is a country/folk confection. Enjoy!",2

Very easy to use, and very easy to put in solution and take out the dirty water. The only downside I have is that the bucket that picks up the dirty water could be bigger so I don't have to empty it as often. But then again, the cleaner is big enough as it is and if it was any bigger it wouldn't fit anywhere to store it.

During that same time, he was highly involved in costume dramas--The 3 and 4 Musketeers, The Count of Monte Cristo, etc. This is a wonderfully done production, by Norman Rosemont, who made many costumers during this time, and it is lavish in detail and rich in its direction. With an all star cast including Sir Ralph Richardson, Patrick McGoohan, and Louis Jordan among others, it is a worthy successor to its predecessors in costumed sword play. michael h maguire",2

The charger only came with the DC part of the cord and after plugging it in, it overheated within an hour or two to the point where it was shorting out my touchpad and burning up so hot I couldn't touch it. After a day of switching back and forth between my work Powerbook charger and the knock-off and still having major overheating issues, I returned the unit to the seller for a replacement.This particular seller was initially helpful, but then failed to send a replacement unit for several weeks. Finally after contacting the seller again, they resent another charger, only for me to discover that it too was defective. The second unit also overheated after 20 minutes or so. Do not buy this charger from this vendor - buy it from Apple or another reputable source.",0

This film, which deals with the Greek mythology of Medea, who killed her children in order to appease the gods, is an artistic telling of the event, from deep colored shots of the ocean to lens filtered wind brushing against the actors shade, this is all visual, but the film is quite utterly boring and thus, we are not interested in the development of sequences which Trier arranges from us. Udo Kier is common in this adaptation and by the end, we are glad that the screen is no longer filled with such blatant incoehesion.",0

"Klein is a man in the process of waking up from our wackyculture's notions of food-as-drugs and this-is-beautiful.This post-modern diet book retrieves the older, more positivevaluations of fat, and attempts to ""transvalue"" fat inanticipation of a possible return to a fat idea of beauty.He supplies some in-depth analysis of some of the moreflawed recent attempts to re-instate the outrageouslylow ideal weight charts of the fifties, and discusses someof the less publicized risks associated with the latestin diet drug cocktails. It's a book worth reading, even ifit self-describes as an attempt to charm you into changingthe way you view fat.

The writing is generally decent or even pretty good, it's well edited and some of these fantasies sound like a lot of fun.

A big attraction of the book was the authors' connection to 1-800-FLOWERS. I expected well designed arrangements, easy enough for a non-professional to re-create. Instead the book contains an odd assortment of cutesy, unattractive arrangements that seem more like craft projects. For example, a bunch of alstroemerias encircled with asparagus stalks, artichokes filled with tulips, and a bunch of purple lisianthus in a glass tumbler covered with plastic craft beads.

This CD is the most boring, placid and unexciting thing I think I've ever heard and I wish so much I never wasted the money. For those out there searching for reggae be very sure to be far more selective and careful than I since reggae comes in so many forms and if you don't find the one right for you you're going to be running for cover from a form not suited for you (Sheesh I am running too.)To sum up this CD ,from my own personal perspective, I'd say first the accoustics are low key, the music is sung like a mexican salsa, and the lyrics seem to be drudged up from a person with little imagination.",0

She tells us only the faintest of details, skips around in time so it is difficult to piece together what happened when, and gives us no context for her actions or her memories.

This multitap is very good! It looks and feels and plays exaclty like the official sony multitap! This is THE multitap to buy for your old school PS2.The only downsides to this multitap is it doesnt support Ps1 multitap games. But that isnt too bad since personally I had only 2 multitap compatitple games for my PS1. And one of them was an abosulote garbage game. Also for me i had a little bit of trouble putting the multitap into the PS2. I kept on thinking it would break if I pushed it in to hard sicne when i would try to put the multitap intot he PS2 i felt resistance. So that kind of got annoying..but once you get the multitap in..its a balll park from there on!!Buy this mulitap you won't be dissapointed!!!,2

The battery will usually last at least a week or more while taking a few snap shots a day. I highly recommend it as an alternative to a big--slow--expensive camera.

"I bought this cleaner a week ago. Used it for the first time a few days ago. It cleaned some older stains fairly well. I would see this being a better shampooer for catching stains early and removing them. I would see it working very well for this application. If you have older stains in your carpet it is not going to work miracles. It will clean it some but you would have to have a shampooer with more power or possibly have it professionally cleaned to get these older stains out. I bought a dog about 8 months ago and wish I would have purchased this with the dog. I could have gotten these stains out immediately and saved $$ in the long run in not having to have it professionally cleaned.It does seems somewhat cheaply made. I see this as a shampooer that you will have to handle with care. No swinging it around and banging it up against wall, etc. We shall see how well it holds up over timeI would recommend this to anyone in the market for a functional, cheap shampooer.",2

Whenever I wear Realm perfume, I get tons of compliments on how great it smells. I wanted to test the theory a bit (not everyone can wear most scents - they take to everyone's body chemistry differently), so I gave samples to my mom and my friends. They all came back clamoring for it - everyone had the same reaction (which is funny, since I usually do better with citrus and fruit scents, my mom wears florals, my aunt prefers powdery fragrances - you would think that there would be SOMEone on whom it didn't smell as nice).

"I like Rosie. Her humour, her compassion, her philathropic values. She is a great woman - or so she presents herself to be - inside and out. This book 'Everything Rosie' is a biography and anecdotal book about the life of the actress/comedian Rosie O'Donnell. From the death of her mother at the mere age of 10, her talk show and to when she first became a mother to Parker.This a great book for fans to learn a little bit more about Rosie and where she comes from. You understand her a little bit better at the end of the book and admire her that much more.The book is written in different formats, using song exceprts, AOL snippets and show by show guest lists.Recommended for the fan by a fan . . . not for someone who does not enjoy Rosie O'Donnell",2

Still, this book was a very helpful introduction to oxygen therapies, and the use of a medical grade ozone machine has made a significant difference to her.It is important to use it carefully. She has learned the hard way that you can use too much of it. It would be helpful to see more about this in the next book.

I had first seen this film with the Tangerine Dream score so the Goldsmith score was a terrible distraction to me. The T.D. music framed and complemented the film much more and really added a beautiful touch to the atmosphere of the movie.This is still a great film and is one of the best performances by Tim Curry.

It was a nice tour for this Yankee, but there were not enough outdoor scenes of beautiful Savannah, one of my complaints of the film.

The rest was all in all superb, the scenes in the Mercer House all well done, and the acting just as good. Nice wry humor with Cusik/writer character too.

"Although the writing is not the most polished this book has a lot of information that will be new to the neophyte espionage readers and even manages to sneak in a few things that are very good for every day life that most of us either don't know or ignore. It is written from a very personal point of view, as if the author was just sitting in your living room and was an acquaintance. The problem I find with that is that most people, including myself, will take anything someone we don't really know with a grain of salt and this takes away from the book; there's a point in the book where you begin to doubt the veracity of it. Most of the non-espionage claims can be authenticated easily enough but there's a lingering doubt as to the participation of the author in these events the way he described it. The book is worth reading.",2

"We bought three of these when our building's boiler died, and while initially we were really pleased, a month later two out of three of them have died. The first one was clearly not right from the beginning--every time we turned it on, it blew the fuse. Back it went to the store. We figured it was just bad luck, since the other two were fine. But this weekend I went to turn off the second one and felt a huge static-y shock when I touched the button. Later in the day when I went to turn it back on, the light went on but not the fan or heater. It's dead.The third one is still chugging along, so I guess it's ok, but the thermostat never really worked on any of them--we've just used the high/low setting.End result: Don't waste your money.

In less than a year the rubber wire attachment at the top of the remote has opened up and exposed the copper wiring underneath. It still works fine, but I am waiting for it to start failing me. I don't like to have potential problems lurking in my camera bag so this really causes me anxiety. I'm thinking of buying the cheaper after-market one as a backup for when this does stop working.Bottom Line: the above review is the review I would expect to read for the cheap after-market version.

"Most people watching this film are likely familiar with the story of Stephen Glass, so I won't bother to go into the plotline.This is, undoubtedly, a good movie. Hayden Christensen turns in a quality performance as Glass - and it's nice to see what he can do given good material after that Star Wars debacle. Peter Sarsgaard is also well-cast as the editor who uncovers Glass' crime. And, for the most part, the direction is farely well-paced, never becoming overly sensational or getting caught up in the details and forgetting to tell the story.All that said, I don't believe that this is the ""great"" movie everybody is giving it credit for. I'd recommend it for all to see, but it'll never, for me, make any kind of fave movie list.",2

Nonetheless, the screws et cetera seem to be of good quality and the price is good. I suggest that in the description you state that they ONLY fit foreign or Japanese cars from a certain model year to the present! I'm keeping them, as it would be too much of a hassle and expense to mail back this inexpensive kit. If and when I buy a new car, and if it happens to be a foreign car, perhaps I will then be able to use these screws. Time will tell, but for now, I'm screwed.",0

"I heard good things about this band, and I've listened with an open mind, hoping to be impressed, but I just completely fail to see what other people seem to in this music. I'm all for melodic rocking guitar dynamics, the stuff Swervedriver and Archers Of Loaf released around the same time this album came out still sounds fresh and interesting to me, but Jawbox just sounds dull and dated. Their songs just float past uneventfully, a few jagged riffs here and there might catch your ear, but there's nothing that really works or creates any kind of flow. This is the kind of thing I can see people who like ""post-punk"" such as Fugazi, Wire, and Magazine getting into, but if you're like me and you prefer the more fluid melodic style of guitar intricacy, such as Superchunk and Hum, you probably won't find this album very worthwhile.",0

"Really satisfying and realistically erotic love story -- okay, so there's a lot of poetic license because it's just perfect -- but I can't get over how Farrington gets the female side of the story. It's NOT a male fantasy about how women fall in love and why, or have sex, it's a female one. Like ""Something's Gotta Give"" and that one with Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin. What if all your fantasies came true???? Alec wants you back, you cure Nicholson of his womanizing, a sexy, decent, deep-thinking man with holey underwear moves in downstairs. Hey, that happened to me once (I kicked him out after three months).I think I like that Rebecca has grown up enough to know that falling in love when you're young is fantastical, so you look for something more real when the fairy tale turns sour. And then, boom, you fall in love again, and it's just as crazy as the first time, and you say, what the hell, that's life.",2

You get to see each movie in its theatrical widescreen glory. The bonus disc is loaded with good features that any Freddy fan would appreciate. Why don't I give this boxset a fifth star? Well, because I thought that all of the movies were good except for Part 5. Each sequel has received mixed reviews but isn't that usually how it is with B-flicks?

First small didn't fit (our baby was over 8 lbs) then when they did fit they always leaked. Also, because it is an all-in-one diaper it takes ages to dry. You would need three full sets becuase they take an entire day to dry. For new parents looking to take the cloth diaper option I would recommend the fuzzi bunz cloth diapers, the adjustable fit means you can use them from day one and because of the pocket insert they dry quickly.

"After I got the Wii, I heard about SSBB. I was very excited to get it in March, 2008. When I finally got it, I loved it. This game really looks like a PS3 or a 360 game. The character selection is much better than Melee's. Almost every single Nintendo character is in this game plus Solid Snake and Sonic the Hedgehog. The story is the best Nintendo story so far in my opinion. I love the dark feel to it. There's also TONS of music from Nintendo, Metal Gear, and Sonic. Item selection is very deep. The Stages? All detailed and pretty fun to fight on. My faves are Sonic, Meta Knight, Fox, Wario, Donkey Kong, Captain Falcon, Marth, Lucario, Snake, and Link. Hardcore gamers should get this game because there is NO motion-control. This is worth a Wii along with other Nintendo games. overall 5/5",2

So, you cheap asses can't bitch about paying for the extra disc. You virtually get that for free!The levels are obviously brought up and everything sounds a bit cleaner and even. I felt they did a really good job with the packaging considering the price of the double CD set. If you already have it on CD or vinyl.

True, its written by a very successful and funny comedienne but there's so much more to it than that.This is the type of book that you find yourself thinking about long after the last page is turned. For instance, you wonder why she put ""A Comic Novel"" on the cover and why this particular title for the book.There are many different degrees to this novel - it IS comical but its also very serious - about show business, about how hard it is to get started but mostly about friends and relationships and what happens to them when life happens.As Mindy's mother would say, ""Fish banana"".

"As a Kabbalist Jew of Spanish descent, I'm not really certain what the author of this book seeks to achieve for the uninitiated. If any wonder why the mystics such as Luria died at an early age, including the Ari Kaplan of blessed memory, it may very well be because they violated the Oral Law prohibiting the dissimination of this mystical knowledge outside the realm of the faithful. For many, including pop stars of today, not understanding what is to be taken literally vs. figuratively has led people astray from the simple truths of the written [revealed] Torah/Pentatuch which form the very foundation of Kabbalah through the Hebraic science of Gematria.",0

"As an electronics packaging engineer, I really get tired of getting the runaround from the heatsink companies and was hoping to find a book that gave me a straight-forward process for physically designing a heatsink. Instead I found myself falling asleep in front of a text that gave me flashbacks to my college years. I realize that theory is valuable, but if it is not put to the test it is worth no more than the paper on which it is written. The amount of practical insight in this book was derived from references and was enough to fit in a thimble. Examples were few and far between and although written like a textbook, there were no problems to work through to cement the theory. Face it John Wiley & Sons, this book should have been named ""Theory of Heatsink Design and Analysis"". The academicians will love it, but for those of us with our feet on the floor and noses to the grindstone...forget this one!",0

After personally trying a number of ellypticals at a number of sporting good stores my wife tried this one out at one of the big chains and really liked it. After trying it out myself I was surprised at how much more stable and smooth it performed compared to machines costing $300.00 or more. I went on line and found a number of favorable reviews and also noticed that amazon sold this machine for a great price and offered free shipping. Since there was no tax it was about $100 cheaper to buy on line! It was a bit complex to assemble but nothing dramatic. For the price and quality you can't beat it. We have been using it for about one month and really love it. I like the fact that it is easy to move and not too large. My only wish is that the display would have a back light but that's just a minor detail compared to the performance so far!,2

I would buy it for Jackal but because i am not that psycho kind of guy and didn't like 12 monkeys so much i can't really say which one is better! 12 Monkeys is a psychological film that needs some thinking in order to enjoy it and the jackal is an excellent action film that doesn't need further comments. I would like to add that both Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis cooperate really well in the film and that the jackal gets sick sometimes in the film because of too much blood. Despite that i think they are both films worth watching them and nice to spend your time with!,2

It is extremely fummy while allowing the viewer something to chew on after the final credits roll. By using an 'Alien' themes of predjudice and precieved cliches are preasented in a way that is both entertaining and thought provoking.

Wonderful melodies along with excellent lyrics propel this pleasurable disc. At times it reminds me of Merrill Bainbridge's debut disc, which was also a wondeful collection of pop music.

I ordered 3 tubes from Amazon on Mar 12, 2012 and the product is as bad I have read in some recent reviews. The ingredients did not match what I saw online; corn syrup now being the main ingredient. The gel is not as solid as before and it comes out of the tube (which now has a larger opening) in a looser, stickier mess that it used to (when barley malt syrup was used, although I'm not sure if that's the only difference). Only one of our cats doesn't like the new recipe, but it's so much messier that I don't think I'll order it again.",0

Solo Works & Transcriptions is a 1989 BMG Music recording starring Rachmaninoff as he plays his own works. These have originally been recorded between 1925 and 1942.

With over 30 plus characters it may very well be one of the widest selections on the market.

The only downside is that some peoples moves require all three punch buttons to be used at the same time, and with the awkward shape of the dreamcast controller that might be quite a challenge in it's own right.

"It is a questionable practice for a producer to make all his protagonists completely unsympathetic. Characters ranged from driven by lust and gluttony to selfishly using others to gain quick wealth (greed and vanity). Even though the plot allows the possibility of a character arc and redemption, the main protagonist barely takes advantage of it. I initially preferred to give this zero stars, but on further consideration I think one star is justified: this movie proves to me that Sacha Baron Cohen cannot act, so I saved myself from seeing Borat. On the other hand, I give this three stars for Boring and five stars for Stupid, giving it an overall rating of four stars on my BS scale.",0

"This book is the epitome of trash. I thought it would be interesting to read about the Johnny Gosch story ,but instead, I was treated to the sloppiest example of a book I have ever seen. Noreen Gosch must have spent a week on this one, there are a gazillion typos on every page, and the book repeats itself a million times in an attempt to fill up space. I know she isn't a professional writer, but I think if she were really passionate about the book, that she would have written that way. This was very poorly edited, if it was edited at all. She would have done a better job by making a picture book with a lot of captions, or better yet, since she is obviously into cutting corners, reprinting the Denny's placemat that she scribbled this book on. This was a pure waste of time trying to make any practical sense out of this...despite the scary subject matter.",0

"Star Trek has been a fan favorite for a while, but I think that Buck Rogers and Battlestar Galactica (specially) were two Sci-Fi series that racked right up there with it.Battlestar specially did a great job. It had an unoriginal story line (lost in space/have to find home type of thing), but presented it in such an original and involving way that it really grabbed the audience. You really cared for the characters. You really wanted them to find Earth.It was Ulysses' adventures for the future, and I know that you have heard it before, but it also WAS ""the Star Wars for the small screen"".Some of the characters are now classics Lorne Greene as Adama, Dirk Benedict as Starbuck (did the coffee giant plagiarize?).As for Buck... well Buck was Buck. A likable, funny and just plain fun television series.Overall, to all that love space travel Sci-Fi, and who haven't been exposed to these two great series, this is the perfect tape to buy.",2

"A friend introduced me to Metric and after hearing this album, I have fallen in love with them. Emily Haines is one of the most amazing women of the 21st century. She adds vigor, uniqueness, and spark to all of the music and songs. When you listen to the first song, you have to listen to the second. When you listen to the second, you have to listen to the third. Some albums give you the feeling as if you have to skip over songs because they're either boring or something that isn't to your liking. Not with Metric! Every single song is amazing. I'm always in the mood to listen to metric, especially when i'm down, because it just gets you feeling like you did something right and that you're not the only person on this earth that feels like they're dying right now.

I strongly recommend you avoid these and the fact that Feit has continued selling these things suggests to me that they are a company to avoid!!The bulbs overheat and are short-lived. There is not consistency in the way the bulbs fit in holders. Sometimes a bulb will fit properly and make good contact in one holder and not in others. Often they lose contact and flicker or go out and they have to be carefully adjusted by turning them slightly. I removed these several months ago after having fought them for about 4 years. I bought replacement bulbs or complete units 4 different times over that time. There has been no detectable improvement.Very satisfied with led strips purchased from Amazon that these were replaced with. I cut strips from 5 meter rolls. We found that it required 2 parallel strips to give adequate light. This solution does require a little wiring and soldering.,0

This bag is wonderful for my Canon 7D and lenses and accessories. It has plenty of room and lots of padding to protect your equipment. The straps on the side come in handy for carrying your tripod or straping your jacket to your bag if you get hot while shooting pics. The only complaint I have at all is that the top of the straps seem to be a bit too close together. Perhaps as I wear it more they will soften up an little and won't feel like they're pinching my shoulders.

"This is the nicest standard zoom lens you'll find. It's sharp, high-contrast, and low aberration at nearly all zoom levels and apertures. If you're going to step your toes into Canon's L line, this is the place to start. Giving you five standard focal lengths (24, 28, 35, 50, and 70 mm) this lens is an ideal high-quality everyday lens. Further, the quiet USM autofocuses nearly instantly, and the full-time manual focus ring rotates like butter.If I had to pick one problem with this, it would be the weight. At about 2.5lbs, it's surprisingly heavy, especially when you've been wielding it for several hours. Also, it's immense size grabs the attention of strangers, which depending on what you're doing, could be problematic.But in the end, when what I'm doing demands high quality and versatility, this is the lens I rely on.

"I bought this not even two years ago, and it has already given up the ghost. For the first say year or so it worked perfectly - my only complaint was that there is no 'auto-feed' button. Well, that and that the system seemed to struggle with about 4-6 pages at a time (even though it's a 10-sheet shredder). But the main problem has come within the last month, when the system decided to stop feeding more than about 1/3 of a page at a time. The online help didn't give me too much advice, but it mentioned that the gears may have been gummed up. I spent time cleaning it extensively (there was a fair amount of paper left in the gears), but no hope. Guess I need another shredder now.",0

"This film is taken from a stage play by John Patrick Shandly, and unfortunately he also wrote the screenplay for Doubt. From the beginning we can see something is missing, the head nun's suspicions arise suddenly without time for exposition. For anyone who had the misfortune to go to a Catholic grade school during this era (me) this film will bring back memories, most of them not good. The ending purports to be dramatic, but it is ambiguous and will leave you confused. The problem here is we have a three hour play trimmed down for a two hour script. There is a glaring loss of continuity. I worked in insurance claims for 25 years and handled a great number of identical claims. This may be theatrical, but it gets nowhere near the actual way it was.",0

The benefits are endless including high retention, referrals, and a better quality of life (other than the Sunday phone calls to the house). This book is becoming increasingly more important as we shift into a relationship focused economy where the consumers now how an abundance of choice and business owners have to do a lot more for loyalty.

"This was a great story. While the first half of the book was a little hard to get through, the second half more than made up for it. I have not read Something Borrowed and I was therefore unfamiliar with the other side of Rachel and Dex's story. It is hard to like Darcy in the first part of the book but you cant help feeling a little sorry for her. She is extremely self centered. She reminded me of a three year old and I remember thinking that she had some serious growing up to do. In the second part of the book, Darcy comes to realize some of her character flaws and begins trying to become a better person. Ethan was one of the sweetest characters Ive met in a long time. The dynamics of his relationship with Darcy, evolving from friendship to a steadfast love, was down right poignant. It makes you think about life, friendship, and love. That what you think you want for yourself in life is not always what will make you happy.",2

"This was a really bad book by an incredible writer who was trying to do too much with too little. Some have argued that the story, told almost completely in dialogue form is a wonderful demonstration of stretching and using language to its fullest; all I came away with was a jumbled up mess and a feeling that much of my time was wasted. Since this is Philip Roth, one of the 4 or 5 best living writers on the planet, it's easy to be caught up in what he intends to accomplish and the way the title works on multiple levels all the way through the text. Unfortunately, this book is one of those duds that you hope you never have to see a gifted writer produce (Brazil by John Updike is another I can think of).I really have no idea how people enjoyed this one. You're much better off reading anything, and I mean anything by Roth.",0

Of course it matters for development, no one needs to be told that (except perhaps for some over-credentialized quacks passing as social scientists).But while the authors may be from Harvard they are seriously under-educated on cultural analysis, anthropology and sociology. Unwittingly (I think), this book borders on arguments that are racist, essentialist, and very very naive. Culture matters - yes - but these goofs are not telling us anything useful about it. What's more they dont even know how to frame the issue. The question is not IF culture matters - but HOW.",0

"King really does not know how to write a bad novel. Such is the depth of her imaginative penetration of her characters' minds and hearts that the reader finishes her books knowing the characters better than most of their real acquaintances. King specializes in strong women confronted by serious challenges, some of which exist in the worlds they live in, and some of which are internal. This science fiction novel imagines a post-catastrophic world in which women are the adventurers as a matter of necessity, men having been sharply reduced as a percentage of the population. Among the pleasures of the novel are the heroine, Dian, an action hero who must accomplish a great feat of liberation while (unexpectedly) pregnant, and two male characters who inspire Dian to heroics without being action heroes themselves. To say nothing of the dog. If you're interested in character tested by ordeals and the best qualities of dogs and humans, you will be thrilled by this book.",2

It is inconceivable to me that a brand name like Brita can't make a pitcher you can pour from without 1/3 of the water you try to pour spilling out from the poorly designed pitcher lid. I thought perhaps I had just received one that was slightly misshaped but now having read the other reviews realize it is a design flaw.This is not a cheap item and while the idea of having an additional filter for your water may be appealing to some I promise you that you will not be satisfied with this faulty product. I happened to buy this at a discount club but came to Amazon after the fact to look at other reviews. I didn't think I needed to `research' Brita in the water filtration business. I strongly recommend that Amazon stops selling this product as it is not something you would want to be associated with.How can you sell a $60+ pitcher in 2011 that you cannot pour from?,0

"Although my favorite King recordings are from the 50s, this is very dispensible material. It's the throw-away jukebox recordings all black recording stars seem to have been obliged to do at some stage.Although the big band is punchy, the songs are uniformly poor, with King sounding foolish singing about teenage themes and school girls. The arrangements are often tastless, and worst of all, King's guitar sound is bad. He sounds like someone just starting out, not the veteran he already was by that time.The nadir is a pop song based on the ""Kumbyah"" theme, which is not only bad in its own right, but incompetently arranged as well.",0

"I have been using Taxcut for about 10 years and always very satisfied before. However, this year I found the CA Part year Resident software to have several flaws and next year I will be switching to Turbo Tax. I found that the CA software did not carry forward, or ask me what share of my pension should be taxed in CA. this would have resulted in a significant under reporting of my taxable income to CA. subsequently I pulled down the CA instructions from CA and checked everything manually. I also discovered that the format shown online was not the format the part year form printed in. I submitted my taxes on January 31, so it could be that HR Block corrected these problems later, but ....One additional note: I emailed Taxcut with my concern, and a month later no response has been received.",0

To paraphrase what a previous reviewer said, however, despite the obvious truth of the material I've read so far, the hard part is making a personal commitment to get off the life-addiction merry-go-round, and commit to focus on ACIM's teachings long enough & deeply enough to get the REAL benefits from your heart right down to your socks.

"After reading all the wonderful things that Xylitol does, I've been chewing the peppermint version, and now the chocolate. (Xylitol helps to re-deposit the mineral layer that wears off over time on your teeth, it helps with dry mouth, and has even been shown to reduce earaches in children.)I think we are so used to the current vogue of extreme flavors in gum and mints that Xylichew might be too mild for some.

It would have 5 stars if the flavor lasted a wee bit longer, but still highly reccomended.",2
