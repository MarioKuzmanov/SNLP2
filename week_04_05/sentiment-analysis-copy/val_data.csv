Brian Noyes studied the grid thoroughly and has written a readable book which guide you in understanding the datagridview step by step. For me it is however pretty hard to understand the code Brian supplies in C#. In my opinion VB is better suited for learning purposes especially. Sometimes Brian uses tough coding which I can't grasp.,2

"Akhenaten has long been a favorite of Egyptologists...and like many of the other reviewers I've followed the available published material over the years. Unlike some other works, this book is shorter and more readily accessible, especially for those without their MA in history. That said...if this topic interests you, please seek out more information. Other reviews have fabulous suggestions.Great illustrations, succinct text, and a new theory on the identity of ""Smenkhare"" make this book well worth reading.",2
Yah me too,1
"flawless film , ( wang ) ",2
